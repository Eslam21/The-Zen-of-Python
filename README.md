## What is the zen of python ?
The Zen of Python is a collection of **19** principles for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999.

You can view it by writing the bleow command and running it in python:
```python
import this
```

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
## What's in the repository?
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that explore some of the fundamental concepts in Python programming. The notebooks are inspired by the famous "Zen of Python" poem, which encapsulates the guiding principles of Python philosophy.

The notebooks are intended to be interactive and engaging, with code examples, explanations, and exercises to help you deepen your understanding of Python concepts.
