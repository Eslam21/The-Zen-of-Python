### `setup()`

The `setup()` function is a core component of `setuptools`, a Python library used for packaging and distributing Python projects. It takes various parameters to describe the package and its requirements. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:

#### 1. `name`

```python
name='numpy_toolbox',
```

- **Purpose**: Specifies the name of the package. This is the name under which the package will be listed on PyPI and used when importing the package.
- **Details**: 
  - Should be unique to avoid conflicts with other packages.
  - Follow naming conventions (e.g., use lowercase letters and underscores).

#### 2. `version`

```python
version='0.1',
```

- **Purpose**: Indicates the current version of the package.
- **Details**:
  - Use semantic versioning (e.g., `major.minor.patch`).
  - Increment versions based on changes (e.g., `0.1` for initial release, `0.2` for minor changes, `1.0` for major updates).

#### 3. `author`

```python
author='Eslam Mohamed',
```

- **Purpose**: Specifies the name of the person or organization that created the package.
- **Details**:
  - Helps users know who to contact for questions or issues.
  - Optional but recommended for clarity.

#### 4. `author_email`

```python
author_email='your.email@example.com',
```

- **Purpose**: Provides the email address of the package author.
- **Details**:
  - Useful for users to reach out for support or feedback.
  - Optional but helpful.

#### 5. `description`

```python
description='A toolbox for numerical operations with NumPy',
```

- **Purpose**: A brief summary of what the package does.
- **Details**:
  - Appears in search results on PyPI and other package repositories.
  - Should be concise and informative.

#### 6. `long_description`

```python
long_description=open('README.md').read(),
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a detailed description of the package, usually sourced from a README file.
- **Details**:
  - Helps users understand the package's features, installation instructions, and usage.
  - The content of this field is shown on the package’s PyPI page.
  - Ensure the file path is correct and the file is properly formatted.

#### 7. `long_description_content_type`

```python
long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
```

- **Purpose**: Specifies the format of the `long_description` content (e.g., Markdown or reStructuredText).
- **Details**:
  - Use `'text/markdown'` if your README is in Markdown format.
  - Use `'text/x-rst'` if your README is in reStructuredText format.

#### 8. `url`

```python
url='https://github.com/username/numpy_toolbox',
```

- **Purpose**: Provides the URL for the project’s homepage or repository.
- **Details**:
  - Typically links to a GitHub repository or project homepage.
  - Helps users find more information about the project or contribute to it.

#### 9. `license`

```python
license='MIT',
```

- **Purpose**: Indicates the license under which the package is distributed.
- **Details**:
  - Helps users understand the terms under which they can use, modify, or distribute the package.
  - Common choices include MIT, Apache 2.0, and GPL.

#### 10. `keywords`

```python
keywords='numpy numerical operations matrix statistics',
```

- **Purpose**: Provides search keywords that help users find the package.
- **Details**:
  - Include relevant terms related to the package’s functionality.
  - Helps improve the package’s visibility on PyPI and search engines.

#### 11. `python_requires`

```python
python_requires='>=3.6',
```

- **Purpose**: Specifies the minimum Python version required to use the package.
- **Details**:
  - Ensures compatibility with certain Python versions.
  - Helps users avoid installation issues related to incompatible Python versions.

#### 12. `classifiers`

```python
classifiers=[
    'Development Status :: 3 - Alpha',
    'Intended Audience :: Developers',
    'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10',
    'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11',
    'Operating System :: OS Independent',
],
```

- **Purpose**: Provides metadata about the package to help users understand its development status, target audience, and compatibility.
- **Details**:
  - `Development Status`: Indicates the stability of the package (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Production).
  - `Intended Audience`: Describes who the package is meant for (e.g., Developers).
  - `License`: States the package’s license.
  - `Programming Language`: Lists supported Python versions.
  - `Operating System`: Specifies compatibility with different operating systems.

#### 13. `packages`

```python
packages=find_packages(),
```

- **Purpose**: Lists the packages to be included in the distribution.
- **Details**:
  - `find_packages()` automatically detects and lists all packages in the directory.
  - Ensures all relevant packages are included in the distribution.

#### 14. `install_requires`

```python
install_requires=[
    'numpy>=1.21.0',
],
```

- **Purpose**: Lists the package’s dependencies.
- **Details**:
  - Specifies which other packages need to be installed for your package to work.
  - Ensure dependencies are listed with their minimum required versions.

#### 15. `include_package_data`

```python
include_package_data=True,
```

- **Purpose**: Indicates whether to include additional files specified in `MANIFEST.in` in the distribution.
- **Details**:
  - Set to `True` if you want to include extra files like documentation, data files, etc.

#### 16. `zip_safe`

```python
zip_safe=False,
```

- **Purpose**: Specifies whether the package can be reliably used if installed as a .egg file.
- **Details**:
  - Set to `False` if the package contains non-Python files or is not suitable for zip-format installations.
